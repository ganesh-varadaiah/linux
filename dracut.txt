NAME
       dracut - low-level tool for generating an initramfs/initrd image

SYNOPSIS
       dracut [OPTION...] [<image> [<kernel version>]]

DESCRIPTION
       Create an initramfs <image> for the kernel with the version <kernel version>. If <kernel version> is omitted, then the version of the
       actual running kernel is used. If <image> is omitted or empty, depending on bootloader specification, the default location can be
       /efi/<machine-id>/<kernel-version>/initrd, /boot/<machine-id>/<kernel-version>/initrd, /boot/efi/<machine-id>/<kernel-version>/initrd,
       /lib/modules/<kernel-version>/initrd or /boot/initramfs-<kernel-version>.img.

       dracut creates an initial image used by the kernel for preloading the block device modules (such as IDE, SCSI or RAID) which are needed
       to access the root filesystem, mounting the root filesystem and booting into the real system.

       At boot time, the kernel unpacks that archive into RAM disk, mounts and uses it as initial root file system. All finding of the root
       device happens in this early userspace.

       Initramfs images are also called "initrd".

       For a complete list of kernel command line options see dracut.cmdline(7).

       If you are dropped to an emergency shell, while booting your initramfs, the file /run/initramfs/rdsosreport.txt is created, which can
       be saved to a (to be mounted by hand) partition (usually /boot) or a USB stick. Additional debugging info can be produced by adding
       rd.debug to the kernel command line. /run/initramfs/rdsosreport.txt contains all logs and the output of some tools. It should be
       attached to any report about dracut problems.

USAGE
       To create a initramfs image, the most simple command is:

           # dracut

       This will generate a general purpose initramfs image, with all possible functionality resulting of the combination of the installed
       dracut modules and system tools. The image, depending on bootloader specification, can be /efi/<machine-id>/<kernel-version>/initrd,
       /boot/<machine-id>/<kernel-version>/initrd, /boot/efi/<machine-id>/<kernel-version>/initrd, /lib/modules/<kernel-version>/initrd or
       /boot/initramfs-<kernel-version>.img and contains the kernel modules of the currently active kernel with version <kernel-version>.

       If the initramfs image already exists, dracut will display an error message, and to overwrite the existing image, you have to use the
       --force option.

           # dracut --force

       If you want to specify another filename for the resulting image you would issue a command like:

           # dracut foobar.img

       To generate an image for a specific kernel version, the command would be:

           # dracut foobar.img 2.6.40-1.rc5.f20

       A shortcut to generate the image at the default location for a specific kernel version is:

           # dracut --kver 2.6.40-1.rc5.f20

       If you want to create lighter, smaller initramfs images, you may want to specify the --hostonly or -H option. Using this option, the
       resulting image will contain only those dracut modules, kernel modules and filesystems, which are needed to boot this specific machine.
       This has the drawback, that you can’t put the disk on another controller or machine, and that you can’t switch to another root
       filesystem, without recreating the initramfs image. The usage of the --hostonly option is only for experts and you will have to keep
       the broken pieces. At least keep a copy of a general purpose image (and corresponding kernel) as a fallback to rescue your system.

   Inspecting the Contents
       To see the contents of the image created by dracut, you can use the lsinitrd tool.

           # lsinitrd | less

       To display the contents of a file in the initramfs also use the lsinitrd tool:

           # lsinitrd -f /etc/ld.so.conf
           include ld.so.conf.d/*.conf

   Adding dracut Modules
       Some dracut modules are turned off by default and have to be activated manually. You can do this by adding the dracut modules to the
       configuration file /etc/dracut.conf or /etc/dracut.conf.d/myconf.conf. See dracut.conf(5). You can also add dracut modules on the
       command line by using the -a or --add option:

           # dracut --add module initramfs-module.img

       To see a list of available dracut modules, use the --list-modules option:

           # dracut --list-modules

   Omitting dracut Modules
       Sometimes you don’t want a dracut module to be included for reasons of speed, size or functionality. To do this, either specify the
       omit_dracutmodules variable in the dracut.conf or /etc/dracut.conf.d/myconf.conf configuration file (see dracut.conf(5)), or use the -o
       or --omit option on the command line:

           # dracut -o "multipath lvm" no-multipath-lvm.img

   Adding Kernel Modules
       If you need a special kernel module in the initramfs, which is not automatically picked up by dracut, you have the use the
       --add-drivers option on the command line or the drivers variable in the /etc/dracut.conf or /etc/dracut.conf.d/myconf.conf
       configuration file (see dracut.conf(5)):

           # dracut --add-drivers mymod initramfs-with-mymod.img

   Boot parameters
       An initramfs generated without the "hostonly" mode, does not contain any system configuration files (except for some special
       exceptions), so the configuration has to be done on the kernel command line. With this flexibility, you can easily boot from a changed
       root partition, without the need to recompile the initramfs image. So, you could completely change your root partition (move it inside
       a md raid with encryption and LVM on top), as long as you specify the correct filesystem LABEL or UUID on the kernel command line for
       your root device, dracut will find it and boot from it.

       The kernel command line can also be provided by the dhcp server with the root-path option. See the section called “Network Boot”.

       For a full reference of all kernel command line parameters, see dracut.cmdline(7).

       To get a quick start for the suitable kernel command line on your system, use the --print-cmdline option:

           # dracut --print-cmdline
            root=UUID=8b8b6f91-95c7-4da2-831b-171e12179081 rootflags=rw,relatime,discard,data=ordered rootfstype=ext4

       Specifying the root Device
           This is the only option dracut really needs to boot from your root partition. Because your root partition can live in various
           environments, there are a lot of formats for the root= option. The most basic one is root=<path to device node>:

               root=/dev/sda2

           Because device node names can change, dependent on the drive ordering, you are encouraged to use the filesystem identifier (UUID)
           or filesystem label (LABEL) to specify your root partition:

               root=UUID=19e9dda3-5a38-484d-a9b0-fa6b067d0331

           or

               root=LABEL=myrootpartitionlabel

           To see all UUIDs or LABELs on your system, do:

               # ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid

           or

               # ls -l /dev/disk/by-label

           If your root partition is on the network see the section called “Network Boot”.

       Keyboard Settings
           If you have to input passwords for encrypted disk volumes, you might want to set the keyboard layout and specify a display font.

           A typical german kernel command line would contain:

               rd.vconsole.font=eurlatgr rd.vconsole.keymap=de-latin1-nodeadkeys rd.locale.LANG=de_DE.UTF-8

           Setting these options can override the setting stored on your system, if you use a modern init system, like systemd.

       Blacklisting Kernel Modules
           Sometimes it is required to prevent the automatic kernel module loading of a specific kernel module. To do this, just add
           rd.blacklist=<kernel module name>, with <kernel module name> not containing the .ko suffix, to the kernel command line. For
           example:

               rd.driver.blacklist=mptsas rd.driver.blacklist=nouveau

           The option can be specified multiple times on the kernel command line.

       Speeding up the Boot Process
           If you want to speed up the boot process, you can specify as much information for dracut on the kernel command as possible. For
           example, you can tell dracut, that you root partition is not on a LVM volume or not on a raid partition, or that it lives inside a
           specific crypto LUKS encrypted volume. By default, dracut searches everywhere. A typical dracut kernel command line for a plain
           primary or logical partition would contain:

               rd.luks=0 rd.lvm=0 rd.md=0 rd.dm=0

           This turns off every automatic assembly of LVM, MD raids, DM raids and crypto LUKS.

           Of course, you could also omit the dracut modules in the initramfs creation process, but then you would lose the possibility to
           turn it on on demand.

   Injecting custom Files
       To add your own files to the initramfs image, you have several possibilities.

       The --include option let you specify a source path and a target path. For example

           # dracut --include cmdline-preset /etc/cmdline.d/mycmdline.conf initramfs-cmdline-pre.img

       will create an initramfs image, where the file cmdline-preset will be copied inside the initramfs to /etc/cmdline.d/mycmdline.conf.
       --include can only be specified once.

           # mkdir -p rd.live.overlay/etc/cmdline.d
           # mkdir -p rd.live.overlay/etc/conf.d
           # echo "ip=dhcp" >> rd.live.overlay/etc/cmdline.d/mycmdline.conf
           # echo export FOO=testtest >> rd.live.overlay/etc/conf.d/testvar.conf
           # echo export BAR=testtest >> rd.live.overlay/etc/conf.d/testvar.conf
           # tree rd.live.overlay/
           rd.live.overlay/
           `-- etc
               |-- cmdline.d
               |   `-- mycmdline.conf
               `-- conf.d
                   `-- testvar.conf

           # dracut --include rd.live.overlay / initramfs-rd.live.overlay.img

       This will put the contents of the rd.live.overlay directory into the root of the initramfs image.

       The --install option let you specify several files, which will get installed in the initramfs image at the same location, as they are
       present on initramfs creation time.

           # dracut --install 'strace fsck.ext3 ssh' initramfs-dbg.img

       This will create an initramfs with the strace, fsck.ext3 and ssh executables, together with the libraries needed to start those. The
       --install option can be specified multiple times.

   Network Boot
       If your root partition is on a network drive, you have to have the network dracut modules installed to create a network aware initramfs
       image.

       If you specify ip=dhcp on the kernel command line, then dracut asks a dhcp server about the ip address for the machine. The dhcp server
       can also serve an additional root-path, which will set the root device for dracut. With this mechanism, you have static configuration
       on your client machine and a centralized boot configuration on your TFTP/DHCP server. If you can’t pass a kernel command line, then you
       can inject /etc/cmdline.d/mycmdline.conf, with a method described in the section called “Injecting custom Files”.

       Reducing the Image Size
           To reduce the size of the initramfs, you should create it with by omitting all dracut modules, which you know, you don’t need to
           boot the machine.

           You can also specify the exact dracut and kernel modules to produce a very tiny initramfs image.

           For example for a NFS image, you would do:

               # dracut -m "nfs network base" initramfs-nfs-only.img

           Then you would boot from this image with your target machine and reduce the size once more by creating it on the target machine
           with the --host-only option:

               # dracut -m "nfs network base" --host-only initramfs-nfs-host-only.img

           This will reduce the size of the initramfs image significantly.

TROUBLESHOOTING
       If the boot process does not succeed, you have several options to debug the situation. Some of the basic operations are covered here.
       For more information you should also visit: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/boot/dracut/dracut.html

   Identifying your problem area
        1. Remove 'rhgb' and 'quiet' from the kernel command line

        2. Add 'rd.shell' to the kernel command line. This will present a shell should dracut be unable to locate your root device

        3. Add 'rd.shell rd.debug log_buf_len=1M' to the kernel command line so that dracut shell commands are printed as they are executed

        4. The file /run/initramfs/rdsosreport.txt is generated, which contains all the logs and the output of all significant tools, which
           are mentioned later.

       If you want to save that output, simply mount /boot by hand or insert an USB stick and mount that. Then you can store the output for
       later inspection.

   Information to include in your report
       All bug reports
           In all cases, the following should be mentioned and attached to your bug report:

           •   The exact kernel command-line used. Typically from the bootloader configuration file (e.g.  /boot/grub2/grub.cfg) or from
               /proc/cmdline.

           •   A copy of your disk partition information from /etc/fstab, which might be obtained booting an old working initramfs or a rescue
               medium.

           •   Turn on dracut debugging (see the debugging dracut section), and attach the file /run/initramfs/rdsosreport.txt.

           •   If you use a dracut configuration file, please include /etc/dracut.conf and all files in /etc/dracut.conf.d/*.conf

       Network root device related problems
           This section details information to include when experiencing problems on a system whose root device is located on a network
           attached volume (e.g. iSCSI, NFS or NBD). As well as the information from the section called “All bug reports”, include the
           following information:

           •   Please include the output of

                   # /sbin/ifup <interfacename>
                   # ip addr show

   Debugging dracut
       Configure a serial console
           Successfully debugging dracut will require some form of console logging during the system boot. This section documents configuring
           a serial console connection to record boot messages.

            1. First, enable serial console output for both the kernel and the bootloader.

            2. Open the file /boot/grub2/grub.cfg for editing. Below the line 'timeout=5', add the following:

                   serial --unit=0 --speed=9600
                   terminal --timeout=5 serial console

            3. Also in /boot/grub2/grub.cfg, add the following boot arguments to the 'kernel' line:

                   console=tty0 console=ttyS0,9600

            4. When finished, the /boot/grub2/grub.cfg file should look similar to the example below.

                   default=0
                   timeout=5
                   serial --unit=0 --speed=9600
                   terminal --timeout=5 serial console
                   title Fedora (2.6.29.5-191.fc11.x86_64)
                     root (hd0,0)
                     kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.29.5-191.fc11.x86_64 ro root=/dev/mapper/vg_uc1-lv_root console=tty0 console=ttyS0,9600
                     initrd /dracut-2.6.29.5-191.fc11.x86_64.img

            5. More detailed information on how to configure the kernel for console output can be found at
               http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-HOWTO/Remote-Serial-Console-HOWTO.html#CONFIGURE-KERNEL.

            6. Redirecting non-interactive output

                   Note
                   You can redirect all non-interactive output to /dev/kmsg and the kernel will put it out on the console when it reaches the
                   kernel buffer by doing

                   # exec >/dev/kmsg 2>&1 </dev/console

       Using the dracut shell
           dracut offers a shell for interactive debugging in the event dracut fails to locate your root filesystem. To enable the shell:

            1. Add the boot parameter 'rd.shell' to your bootloader configuration file (e.g.  /boot/grub2/grub.cfg)

            2. Remove the boot arguments 'rhgb' and 'quiet'

               A sample /boot/grub2/grub.cfg bootloader configuration file is listed below.

                   default=0
                   timeout=5
                   serial --unit=0 --speed=9600
                   terminal --timeout=5 serial console
                   title Fedora (2.6.29.5-191.fc11.x86_64)
                     root (hd0,0)
                     kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.29.5-191.fc11.x86_64 ro root=/dev/mapper/vg_uc1-lv_root console=tty0 rd.shell
                     initrd /dracut-2.6.29.5-191.fc11.x86_64.img

            3. If system boot fails, you will be dropped into a shell as seen in the example below.

                   No root device found
                   Dropping to debug shell.

                   #

            4. Use this shell prompt to gather the information requested above (see the section called “All bug reports”).

       Accessing the root volume from the dracut shell
           From the dracut debug shell, you can manually perform the task of locating and preparing your root volume for boot. The required
           steps will depend on how your root volume is configured. Common scenarios include:

           •   A block device (e.g.  /dev/sda7)

           •   A LVM logical volume (e.g.  /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00)

           •   An encrypted device (e.g.  /dev/mapper/luks-4d5972ea-901c-4584-bd75-1da802417d83)

           •   A network attached device (e.g.  netroot=iscsi:@192.168.0.4::3260::iqn.2009-02.org.example:for.all)

           The exact method for locating and preparing will vary. However, to continue with a successful boot, the objective is to locate your
           root volume and create a symlink /dev/root which points to the file system. For example, the following example demonstrates
           accessing and booting a root volume that is an encrypted LVM Logical volume.

            1. Inspect your partitions using parted

                   # parted /dev/sda -s p
                   Model: ATA HTS541060G9AT00 (scsi)
                   Disk /dev/sda: 60.0GB
                   Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
                   Partition Table: msdos
                   Number  Start   End     Size    Type      File system  Flags
                   1      32.3kB  10.8GB  107MB   primary   ext4         boot
                   2      10.8GB  55.6GB  44.7GB  logical                lvm

            2. You recall that your root volume was a LVM logical volume. Scan and activate any logical volumes.

                   # lvm vgscan
                   # lvm vgchange -ay

            3. You should see any logical volumes now using the command blkid:

                   # blkid
                   /dev/sda1: UUID="3de247f3-5de4-4a44-afc5-1fe179750cf7" TYPE="ext4"
                   /dev/sda2: UUID="Ek4dQw-cOtq-5MJu-OGRF-xz5k-O2l8-wdDj0I" TYPE="LVM2_member"
                   /dev/mapper/linux-root: UUID="def0269e-424b-4752-acf3-1077bf96ad2c" TYPE="crypto_LUKS"
                   /dev/mapper/linux-home: UUID="c69127c1-f153-4ea2-b58e-4cbfa9257c5e" TYPE="ext3"
                   /dev/mapper/linux-swap: UUID="47b4d329-975c-4c08-b218-f9c9bf3635f1" TYPE="swap"

            4. From the output above, you recall that your root volume exists on an encrypted block device. Following the guidance disk
               encryption guidance from the Installation Guide, you unlock your encrypted root volume.

                   # UUID=$(cryptsetup luksUUID /dev/mapper/linux-root)
                   # cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/mapper/linux-root luks-$UUID
                   Enter passphrase for /dev/mapper/linux-root:
                   Key slot 0 unlocked.

            5. Next, make a symbolic link to the unlocked root volume

                   # ln -s /dev/mapper/luks-$UUID /dev/root

            6. With the root volume available, you may continue booting the system by exiting the dracut shell

                   # exit

       Additional dracut boot parameters
           For more debugging options, see dracut.cmdline(7).

       Debugging dracut on shutdown
           To debug the shutdown sequence on systemd systems, you can rd.break on pre-shutdown or shutdown.

           To do this from an already booted system:

               # mkdir -p /run/initramfs/etc/cmdline.d
               # echo "rd.debug rd.break=pre-shutdown rd.break=shutdown" > /run/initramfs/etc/cmdline.d/debug.conf
               # touch /run/initramfs/.need_shutdown

           This will give you a dracut shell after the system pivot’ed back in the initramfs.

OPTIONS
       --kver <kernel version>
           Set the kernel version. This enables to specify the kernel version, without specifying the location of the initramfs image. For
           example:

           # dracut --kver 3.5.0-0.rc7.git1.2.fc18.x86_64

       -f, --force
           Overwrite existing initramfs file.

       <output file> --rebuild
           Append the current arguments to those with which the input initramfs image was built. This option helps in incrementally building
           the initramfs for testing. If optional <output file> is not provided, the input initramfs provided to rebuild will be used as
           output file.

       -a, --add <list of dracut modules>
           Add a space-separated list of dracut modules to the default set of modules. This parameter can be specified multiple times.

               Note
               If the list has multiple arguments, then you have to put these in quotes. For example:

                   # dracut --add "module1 module2"  ...

       --force-add <list of dracut modules>
           Force to add a space-separated list of dracut modules to the default set of modules, when -H is specified. This parameter can be
           specified multiple times.

               Note
               If the list has multiple arguments, then you have to put these in quotes. For example:

                   # dracut --force-add "module1 module2"  ...

       -o, --omit <list of dracut modules>
           Omit a space-separated list of dracut modules. This parameter can be specified multiple times.

               Note
               If the list has multiple arguments, then you have to put these in quotes. For example:

                   # dracut --omit "module1 module2"  ...

       -m, --modules <list of dracut modules>
           Specify a space-separated list of dracut modules to call when building the initramfs. Modules are located in
           /usr/lib/dracut/modules.d. This parameter can be specified multiple times. This option forces dracut to only include the specified
           dracut modules. In most cases the "--add" option is what you want to use.

               Note
               If the list has multiple arguments, then you have to put these in quotes. For example:

                   # dracut --modules "module1 module2"  ...

       -d, --drivers <list of kernel modules>
           Specify a space-separated list of kernel modules to exclusively include in the initramfs. The kernel modules have to be specified
           without the ".ko" suffix. This parameter can be specified multiple times.

               Note
               If the list has multiple arguments, then you have to put these in quotes. For example:

                   # dracut --drivers "kmodule1 kmodule2"  ...

       --add-drivers <list of kernel modules>
           Specify a space-separated list of kernel modules to add to the initramfs. The kernel modules have to be specified without the ".ko"
           suffix. This parameter can be specified multiple times.

               Note
               If the list has multiple arguments, then you have to put these in quotes. For example:

                   # dracut --add-drivers "kmodule1 kmodule2"  ...

       --force-drivers <list of kernel modules>
           See add-drivers above. But in this case it is ensured that the drivers are tried to be loaded early via modprobe.

               Note
               If the list has multiple arguments, then you have to put these in quotes. For example:

                   # dracut --force-drivers "kmodule1 kmodule2"  ...

       --omit-drivers <list of kernel modules>
           Specify a space-separated list of kernel modules not to add to the initramfs. The kernel modules have to be specified without the
           ".ko" suffix. This parameter can be specified multiple times.

               Note
               If the list has multiple arguments, then you have to put these in quotes. For example:

                   # dracut --omit-drivers "kmodule1 kmodule2"  ...

       --filesystems <list of filesystems>
           Specify a space-separated list of kernel filesystem modules to exclusively include in the generic initramfs. This parameter can be
           specified multiple times.

               Note
               If the list has multiple arguments, then you have to put these in quotes. For example:

                   # dracut --filesystems "filesystem1 filesystem2"  ...

       -k, --kmoddir <kernel directory>
           Specify the directory, where to look for kernel modules.

       --fwdir <dir>[:<dir>...]++
           Specify additional directories, where to look for firmwares. This parameter can be specified multiple times.

       --libdirs <list of directories>
           Specify a space-separated list of directories to look for libraries to include in the generic initramfs. This parameter can be
           specified multiple times.

               Note
               If the list has multiple arguments, then you have to put these in quotes. For example:

                   # dracut --libdirs "dir1 dir2"  ...

       --kernel-cmdline <parameters>
           Specify default kernel command line parameters.

           Do not include local /etc/lvm/lvm.conf file.

       --fscks <list of fsck tools>
           Add a space-separated list of fsck tools, in addition to dracut.conf's specification; the installation is opportunistic
           (non-existing tools are ignored).

               Note
               If the list has multiple arguments, then you have to put these in quotes. For example:

                   # dracut --fscks "fsck.foo barfsck"  ...

       --nofscks
           Inhibit installation of any fsck tools.

       --strip
           Strip binaries in the initramfs (default).

       --aggresive-strip
           Strip more than just debug symbol and sections, for a smaller initramfs build. The --strip option must also be specified.

       --nostrip
           Do not strip binaries in the initramfs.

       --hardlink
           Hardlink files in the initramfs (default).

       --nohardlink
           Do not hardlink files in the initramfs.

       --prefix <dir>
           Prefix initramfs files with the specified directory.

       --noprefix
           Do not prefix initramfs files (default).

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

       --debug
           Output debug information of the build process.

       -v, --verbose
           Increase verbosity level (default is info(4)).

       --version
           Display version and exit.

       -q, --quiet
           Decrease verbosity level (default is info(4)).

       -c, --conf <dracut configuration file>
           Specify configuration file to use.

           Default: /etc/dracut.conf

       --confdir <configuration directory>
           Specify configuration directory to use.

           Default: /etc/dracut.conf.d

       --add-confdir <configuration directory>
           Add an extra configuration directory to use *.conf files from. If the directory is not existed, will look for subdirectory under
           confdir.

           Default: empty

       --tmpdir <temporary directory>
           Specify temporary directory to use.

           Default: /var/tmp

       -r, --sysroot <sysroot directory>
           Specify the sysroot directory to collect files from. This is useful to create the initramfs image from a cross-compiled sysroot
           directory. For the extra helper variables, see ENVIRONMENT below.

           Default: empty

       --sshkey <sshkey file>
           SSH key file used with ssh-client module.

       --logfile <logfile>
           Logfile to use; overrides any setting from the configuration files.

           Default: /var/log/dracut.log

       -l, --local
           Activates the local mode. dracut will use modules from the current working directory instead of the system-wide installed modules
           in /usr/lib/dracut/modules.d. This is useful when running dracut from a git checkout.

       -H, --hostonly
           Host-only mode: Install only what is needed for booting the local host instead of a generic host and generate host-specific
           configuration.

               Warning
               If chrooted to another root other than the real root device, use "--fstab" and provide a valid /etc/fstab.

       -N, --no-hostonly
           Disable host-only mode.

       --hostonly-mode <mode>
           Specify the host-only mode to use.  <mode> could be one of "sloppy" or "strict". In "sloppy" host-only mode, extra drivers and
           modules will be installed, so minor hardware change won’t make the image unbootable (e.g. changed keyboard), and the image is still
           portable among similar hosts. With "strict" mode enabled, anything not necessary for booting the local host in its current state
           will not be included, and modules may do some extra job to save more space. Minor change of hardware or environment could make the
           image unbootable.

           Default: sloppy

       --hostonly-cmdline
           Store kernel command line arguments needed in the initramfs.

       --no-hostonly-cmdline
           Do not store kernel command line arguments needed in the initramfs.

       --no-hostonly-default-device
           Do not generate implicit host devices like root, swap, fstab, etc. Use "--mount" or "--add-device" to explicitly add devices as
           needed.

       --hostonly-i18n
           Install only needed keyboard and font files according to the host configuration (default).

       --no-hostonly-i18n
           Install all keyboard and font files available.

       --hostonly-nics <list of nics>
           Only enable listed NICs in the initramfs. The list can be empty, so other modules can install only the necessary network drivers.

       --persistent-policy <policy>
           Use <policy> to address disks and partitions.  <policy> can be any directory name found in /dev/disk. E.g. "by-uuid", "by-label"

       --fstab
           Use /etc/fstab instead of /proc/self/mountinfo.

       --add-fstab <filename>
           Add entries of <filename> to the initramfs /etc/fstab.

       --mount "<device> <mountpoint> <filesystem type> [<filesystem options> [<dump frequency> [<fsck order>]]]"
           Mount <device> on <mountpoint> with <filesystem type> in the initramfs.  <filesystem options>, <dump options> and <fsck order> can
           be specified, see fstab manpage for the details. The default <filesystem options> is "defaults". The default <dump frequency> is
           "0". The default <fsck order> is "2".

       --mount "<mountpoint>"
           Like above, but <device>, <filesystem type> and <filesystem options> are determined by looking at the current mounts.

       --add-device <device>
           Bring up <device> in initramfs, <device> should be the device name. This can be useful in host-only mode for resume support when
           your swap is on LVM or an encrypted partition. [NB --device can be used for compatibility with earlier releases]

       -i, --include <SOURCE> <TARGET>
           Include the files in the SOURCE directory into the TARGET directory in the final initramfs. If SOURCE is a file, it will be
           installed to TARGET in the final initramfs. This parameter can be specified multiple times.

       -I, --install <file list>
           Install the space separated list of files into the initramfs.

               Note
               If the list has multiple arguments, then you have to put these in quotes. For example:

                   # dracut --install "/bin/foo /sbin/bar"  ...

       --install-optional <file list>
           Install the space separated list of files into the initramfs, if they exist.

       --gzip
           Compress the generated initramfs using gzip. This will be done by default, unless another compression option or --no-compress is
           passed. Equivalent to "--compress=gzip -9".

       --bzip2
           Compress the generated initramfs using bzip2.

               Warning
               Make sure your kernel has bzip2 decompression support compiled in, otherwise you will not be able to boot. Equivalent to
               "--compress=bzip2 -9".

       --lzma
           Compress the generated initramfs using lzma.

               Warning
               Make sure your kernel has lzma decompression support compiled in, otherwise you will not be able to boot. Equivalent to
               "--compress=lzma -9 -T0".

       --xz
           Compress the generated initramfs using xz.

               Warning
               Make sure your kernel has xz decompression support compiled in, otherwise you will not be able to boot. Equivalent to
               "--compress=xz --check=crc32 --lzma2=dict=1MiB -T0".

       --lzo
           Compress the generated initramfs using lzop.

               Warning
               Make sure your kernel has lzo decompression support compiled in, otherwise you will not be able to boot. Equivalent to
               "--compress=lzop -9".

       --lz4
           Compress the generated initramfs using lz4.

               Warning
               Make sure your kernel has lz4 decompression support compiled in, otherwise you will not be able to boot. Equivalent to
               "--compress=lz4 -l -9".

       --zstd
           Compress the generated initramfs using Zstandard.

               Warning
               Make sure your kernel has zstd decompression support compiled in, otherwise you will not be able to boot. Equivalent to
               "--compress=zstd -15 -q -T0".

       --compress <compressor>
           Compress the generated initramfs using the passed compression program. If you pass it just the name of a compression program, it
           will call that program with known-working arguments. If you pass a quoted string with arguments, it will be called with exactly
           those arguments. Depending on what you pass, this may result in an initramfs that the kernel cannot decompress. The default value
           can also be set via the INITRD_COMPRESS environment variable.

       --squash-compressor <compressor>
           Compress the squashfs image using the passed compressor and compressor specific options for mksquashfs. You can refer to mksquashfs
           manual for supported compressors and compressor specific options. If squash module is not called when building the initramfs, this
           option will not take effect.

       --no-compress
           Do not compress the generated initramfs. This will override any other compression options.

       --reproducible
           Create reproducible images.

       --no-reproducible
           Do not create reproducible images.

       --list-modules
           List all available dracut modules.

       -M, --show-modules
           Print included module’s name to standard output during build.

       --keep
           Keep the initramfs temporary directory for debugging purposes.

       --printsize
           Print out the module install size.

       --profile
           Output profile information of the build process.

       --ro-mnt
           Mount / and /usr read-only by default.

       -L, --stdlog <level>
           [0-6] Specify logging level (to standard error).

                     0 - suppress any messages
                     1 - only fatal errors
                     2 - all errors
                     3 - warnings
                     4 - info
                     5 - debug info (here starts lots of output)
                     6 - trace info (and even more)

       --regenerate-all
           Regenerate all initramfs images at the default location with the kernel versions found on the system. Additional parameters are
           passed through.

       -p, --parallel
           Try to execute tasks in parallel. Currently only supported with --regenerate-all (build initramfs images for all kernel versions
           simultaneously).

       --noimageifnotneeded
           Do not create an image in host-only mode, if no kernel driver is needed and no /etc/cmdline/*.conf will be generated into the
           initramfs.

       --loginstall <directory>
           Log all files installed from the host to <directory>.

       --uefi
           Instead of creating an initramfs image, dracut will create an UEFI executable, which can be executed by an UEFI BIOS. The default
           output filename is <EFI>/EFI/Linux/linux-$kernel$-<MACHINE_ID>-<BUILD_ID>.efi. <EFI> might be /efi, /boot or /boot/efi depending on
           where the ESP partition is mounted. The <BUILD_ID> is taken from BUILD_ID in /usr/lib/os-release or if it exists /etc/os-release
           and is left out, if BUILD_ID is non-existant or empty.

       --no-uefi
           Disables UEFI mode.

       --no-machineid
           Affects the default output filename of --uefi and will discard the <MACHINE_ID> part.

       --uefi-stub <file>
           Specifies the UEFI stub loader, which will load the attached kernel, initramfs and kernel command line and boots the kernel. The
           default is $prefix/lib/systemd/boot/efi/linux<EFI-MACHINE-TYPE-NAME>.efi.stub.

       --uefi-splash-image <file>
           Specifies the UEFI stub loader’s splash image. Requires bitmap (.bmp) image format.

       --kernel-image <file>
           Specifies the kernel image, which to include in the UEFI executable. The default is /lib/modules/<KERNEL-VERSION>/vmlinuz or
           /boot/vmlinuz-<KERNEL-VERSION>.

       --sbat <parameters>
           Specifies the SBAT parameters, which to include in the UEFI executable. By default the default SBAT string added is "sbat,1,SBAT
           Version,sbat,1, https://github.com/rhboot/shim/blob/main/SBAT.md".

       --enhanced-cpio
           Attempt to use the dracut-cpio binary, which optimizes archive creation for copy-on-write filesystems by using the
           copy_file_range(2) syscall via Rust’s io::copy(). When specified, initramfs archives are also padded to ensure optimal data
           alignment for extent sharing. To retain reflink data deduplication benefits, this should be used alongside the --no-compress and
           --no-strip parameters, with initramfs source files, --tmpdir staging area and destination all on the same copy-on-write capable
           filesystem.

ENVIRONMENT
       INITRD_COMPRESS
           sets the default compression program. See --compress.

       DRACUT_LDCONFIG
           sets the ldconfig program path and options. Optional. Used for --sysroot.

           Default: ldconfig

       DRACUT_LDD
           sets the ldd program path and options. Optional. Used for --sysroot.

           Default: ldd

       DRACUT_TESTBIN
           sets the initially tested binary for detecting library paths. Optional. Used for --sysroot. In the cross-compiled sysroot, the
           default value (/bin/sh) is unusable, as it is an absolute symlink and points outside the sysroot directory.

           Default: /bin/sh

       DRACUT_INSTALL
           overrides path and options for executing dracut-install internally. Optional. Can be used to debug dracut-install while running the
           main dracut script.

           Default: dracut-install

           Example: DRACUT_INSTALL="valgrind dracut-install"

           overrides for compression utilities to support using them from non-standard paths.

           Default values are the default compression utility names to be found in PATH.

       DRACUT_ARCH
           overrides the value of uname -m. Used for --sysroot.

           Default: empty (the value of uname -m on the host system)

       SYSTEMD_VERSION
           overrides systemd version. Used for --sysroot.

       SYSTEMCTL
           overrides the systemctl binary. Used for --sysroot.

       NM_VERSION
           overrides the NetworkManager version. Used for --sysroot.

       DRACUT_INSTALL_PATH
           overrides PATH environment for dracut-install to look for binaries relative to --sysroot. In a cross-compiled environment (e.g.
           Yocto), PATH points to natively built binaries that are not in the host’s /bin, /usr/bin, etc.  dracut-install still needs plain
           /bin and /usr/bin that are relative to the cross-compiled sysroot.

           Default: PATH

       DRACUT_INSTALL_LOG_TARGET
           overrides DRACUT_LOG_TARGET for dracut-install. It allows running dracut-install* to run with different log target that dracut**
           runs with.

           Default: DRACUT_LOG_TARGET

       DRACUT_INSTALL_LOG_LEVEL
           overrides DRACUT_LOG_LEVEL for dracut-install. It allows running dracut-install* to run with different log level that dracut** runs
           with.

           Default: DRACUT_LOG_LEVEL

FILES
       /var/log/dracut.log
           logfile of initramfs image creation

       /tmp/dracut.log
           logfile of initramfs image creation, if /var/log/dracut.log is not writable

       /etc/dracut.conf
           see dracut.conf5

       /etc/dracut.conf.d/*.conf

   Configuration in the initramfs
       /etc/conf.d/
           Any files found in /etc/conf.d/ will be sourced in the initramfs to set initial values. Command line options will override these
           values set in the configuration files.

       /etc/cmdline
           Can contain additional command line options. Deprecated, better use /etc/cmdline.d/*.conf.

       /etc/cmdline.d/*.conf
           Can contain additional command line options.
